## Issue Details

### ISSUE-001: Intrusive Database Coupling
**Problem**: Two incompatible database managers (DatabaseManager and EmailDatabase) operate on the same SQLite file with different schemas, creating data corruption risk.

**Impact**: Critical - data integrity at risk
**Recommendation**: Consolidate to single database manager with unified schema
**Effort**: 1-2 weeks

---

### ISSUE-002: Symmetric Functional Coupling
**Problem**: Identical SMS business logic duplicated across TypeScript and Python implementations, requiring manual synchronization of all rule changes.

**Impact**: Critical - business rules will diverge over time
**Recommendation**: Consolidate to single implementation (TypeScript) or extract to decision service
**Effort**: 2-3 weeks

---

### ISSUE-003: Model Coupling
**Problem**: Inconsistent data structure naming (camelCase vs snake_case) across and within services, preventing integration and code reuse.

**Impact**: High - integration friction, cognitive overhead
**Recommendation**: Establish standards, create shared types package with conversion utilities
**Effort**: 1-2 weeks

---

### ISSUE-004: Temporal Coupling
**Problem**: Server initialization has implicit order dependencies with multiple database connections created in undefined order.

**Impact**: High - race conditions, "database is locked" errors
**Recommendation**: Implement ApplicationContainer with explicit initialization lifecycle
**Effort**: 1 week

---

### ISSUE-005: Missing API Versioning
**Problem**: No API versioning on any HTTP endpoints, making all API changes potentially breaking.

**Impact**: Medium - blocks safe API evolution
**Recommendation**: Implement URL path versioning (/v1/, /v2/, etc.) with deprecation strategy
**Effort**: 3-5 days

---

### ISSUE-006: Database Access Violations
**Problem**: Direct database access bypassing DatabaseManager abstraction, breaking encapsulation.

**Impact**: Medium - fragile abstractions, difficult to refactor
**Recommendation**: Add missing methods to managers, refactor direct access, add linting rules
**Effort**: 2-3 days

---

## Recommended Resolution Order

### Phase 1: Critical Issues (Weeks 1-3)
1. **ISSUE-001** - Database intrusive coupling (P0, 1-2 weeks)
   - Highest data integrity risk
   - Blocks other database improvements

2. **ISSUE-002** - SMS logic duplication (P0, 2-3 weeks)
   - Prevents business rule divergence
   - Can be done in parallel with ISSUE-001

### Phase 2: High Priority (Weeks 4-6)
3. **ISSUE-003** - Model coupling (P1, 1-2 weeks)
   - Enables shared tooling
   - Improves developer experience

4. **ISSUE-004** - Temporal coupling (P1, 1 week)
   - Improves reliability
   - Simplifies testing

### Phase 3: Medium Priority (Week 7)
5. **ISSUE-005** - API versioning (P2, 3-5 days)
   - Enables safe API evolution
   - Quick win

6. **ISSUE-006** - Database access patterns (P2, 2-3 days)
   - Completes database layer cleanup
   - Protects abstractions
   - Should be done after ISSUE-001

## Architecture Decision Records (Recommended)

After resolving these issues, create ADRs for:

- ADR-001: Database Manager Consolidation
- ADR-002: SMS Service Architecture
- ADR-003: Data Modeling Standards
- ADR-004: Service Initialization Lifecycle
- ADR-005: API Versioning Strategy
- ADR-006: Database Access Patterns

## Next Steps

1. Review all issues with the team
2. Prioritize based on your specific context and roadmap
3. Create tasks/tickets in your project management system
4. Assign owners for each issue
5. Schedule regular architecture review meetings
6. Implement prevention strategies to avoid regression
