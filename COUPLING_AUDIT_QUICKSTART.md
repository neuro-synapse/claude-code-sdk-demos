# Coupling Audit Quick Start Guide

**üéØ Goal**: Get your development team up to speed on the audit findings and action items in 15 minutes.

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è 2-Minute Overview

Your codebase has **12 coupling violations** that need fixing. The most critical ones are:

1. **7 independent database connections** (should be 1)
2. **Duplicate data models with different field names** (camelCase vs snake_case)

**Health Score**: 45/100 (Critical)

**Action Required**: Allocate 2 engineers for 4 weeks to fix critical issues.

## üéì Key Concepts (5-Minute Crash Course)

### What is Coupling?

**Coupling** = How much one module depends on another.

**Types** (worst to best):
1. **Intrusive** üî¥ - Direct access to internals (e.g., multiple DB instances)
2. **Functional** üü† - Shared business logic (e.g., duplicated code)
3. **Model** üü° - Shared data structures (e.g., duplicate interfaces)
4. **Contract** üü¢ - Interface dependencies (e.g., API contracts)

**Goal**: Reduce coupling to make code more:
- Testable
- Maintainable
- Flexible
- Reliable

---

### Why Does This Matter?

**Current state**:
```typescript
// 7 different Database instances
const db1 = new Database(path);  // server.ts
const db2 = new Database(path);  // endpoint.ts
const db3 = new Database(path);  // websocket.ts
// ... 4 more
```

**Problems**:
- Race conditions
- "Database is locked" errors
- Data inconsistency
- Hard to test

**Target state**:
```typescript
// Single connection pool
const pool = DatabaseConnectionPool.getInstance();

// Inject into services
const emailRepo = new EmailRepository(pool.getConnection());
const service = new EmailService(emailRepo);  // Easy to mock!
```

**Benefits**:
- No race conditions
- Consistent data
- Easy to test
- Clear dependencies

---

### Repository Pattern (Quick Intro)

**Before** (Raw SQL everywhere):
```typescript
// In endpoint
const email = db.prepare("SELECT * FROM emails WHERE id = ?").get(id);

// In websocket
const emails = db.prepare("SELECT * FROM emails ORDER BY date DESC").all();

// In service
db.run("INSERT INTO emails VALUES (?, ?, ?)", [...]);
```

**Problems**:
- SQL scattered across codebase
- Hard to test
- Can't optimize globally

**After** (Repository Pattern):
```typescript
// Single EmailRepository with all SQL
class EmailRepository {
  getById(id: number): Promise<Email> { ... }
  getRecent(limit: number): Promise<Email[]> { ... }
  insert(email: Email): Promise<number> { ... }
}

// Services use repository
const email = await emailRepo.getById(id);  // Easy to mock!
```

**Benefits**:
- SQL in one place
- Easy to test (mock repository)
- Can optimize queries
- Clear abstraction

## üìä Quick Reference: Issue Severity

| Severity | Fix When | Impact if Ignored |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Critical** üî¥ | Immediately (this sprint) | Data corruption, outages |
| **High** üü† | Soon (1-2 sprints) | Maintenance nightmare, bugs |
| **Medium** üü° | This quarter | Technical debt, slower velocity |
| **Low** ‚ö™ | When convenient | Minor friction, readability |

**Your breakdown**:
- üî¥ Critical: 2 issues
- üü† High: 5 issues
- üü° Medium: 3 issues
- ‚ö™ Low: 2 issues

## üõ†Ô∏è Prevention Checklist

Add these to your workflow:

### Pre-Commit Checks
```bash
# In .git/hooks/pre-commit
! grep -r "new Database" --exclude-dir="infrastructure" --include="*.ts"
! grep -r "export interface EmailRecord" --exclude="domain/models" --include="*.ts"
```

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] No direct `new Database()` calls
- [ ] No SQL queries outside repository layer
- [ ] Dependencies injected via constructor
- [ ] No duplicate interface definitions
- [ ] API endpoints have `/v1/` prefix

### CI/CD Checks (GitHub Actions)
```yaml
- name: Check coupling compliance
  run: |
    ! grep -r "new Database" --exclude-dir="infrastructure"
    ! grep -r "db.prepare" --exclude-dir="repositories"
```

## üí¨ Common Questions

### Q: Is this really critical?
**A**: Yes. The database issues can cause data corruption. The model issues cause silent data loss. Both are production-critical.

### Q: Can we fix this later?
**A**: The longer you wait, the more code builds on the flawed foundation. Fix now = 4 weeks. Fix in 6 months = 12+ weeks.

### Q: This seems like a lot of work for a demo
**A**: If it's just a demo, focus on #001 and #002. If it's evolving to production, do the full plan.

### Q: Can we do this incrementally?
**A**: Yes! The migration strategies are designed for zero downtime. See individual issue files for phased rollout plans.

### Q: What if we don't have 2 engineers for 4 weeks?
**A**: Option 1: Fix #001 only (2 weeks, eliminates data corruption risk). Option 2: Implement "Hybrid Approach" from issue specs (faster but less complete).

### Q: Will this break existing code?
**A**: No if done correctly. Each issue has a migration strategy that maintains backward compatibility during transition.
